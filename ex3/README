Exercise Description
========================
in this exercise we wrote  functions that:
- produce the laplacian pyramid and the gaussian pyramid of an image.
- render and display a pyramid.
- reproduce an image from it's laplacian pyramid
- blend two images using a mask and laplacian blending

========================
Questions
========================

 - Diffrent sizes of imageFilters - as the filter size grows larger the resulting image seems to be sharper and sharper
   this might stem from the fact that when we construct the laplacian pyramid from the guassian one
   we substract the levels from one another and it would be resonable that if we use a larger 
   filter(a harsher low pass filter) less high frequancies would be present in subsequant levels 
   and as a result in the substraction less high frequancies would be substracted.
   so when we add the levels up to recover the image we should get some emplification of the
   higher frequancies as compared to the lower filter size operations
                                    

- different maxLevels - The images seem to be more smoothly blended as the maxlevels goes higher
  (of course up to the maximum possible level)
  it would seem resonable since in every level of the laplacian 
  we use the mask to perform the weighted blending of the two levels
  and the the filter used is more prominent at each level 
  the repeated blurring of the mask should result in  it's weighing of the images 
  to be more and more blended .

Functions
========================
GaussianPyramid - GaussianPyramid produces the gaussian pyramid of the given image 
                  under the maxlevels constraint and using afilter of the required size

LaplacianPyramid - LaplacianPyramid produces the Laplacian pyramid of the given image 
                   under the maxlevels constraint and using afilter of the required size

expand - returns the input level of a pyramid after expansion 
                     
renderPyramid - renderPyramid renders the required levels  input pyramid in a single
                image 
                      
displayPyramid    - displayPyramid display a rendering of #levels of pyr.
                     
LaplacianToImage  - produces the original image~ when provided with it's laplacian pyramid
                    and the gausssian filter used in constructing the pyramid could be used
                    to add filtering by manipulating the coefficient vector

pyramidBlending   - pyramidBlending Blends two images using pyramid belnding
                    the belnding is performed using laplacian pyramid blending with a mask
                    that weights every pixel in the photos to indicate how much to
                     combine from either photo in that pixel.
                     
                 
rgbBlend  - rgbBlend blends two rgb images using the pyramidblend function
