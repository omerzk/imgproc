% Arguments:
% pyr  Gaussian pyramid of a grayscale image having at least 3 levels.
% maxNum  Sets the maximal number of feature points to detect.
% Returns:
% pos  An nx2 matrix of [x,y] feature positions per row found in pyr. These
% coordinates are provided at the pyramid level pyr{1}.
% desc  A kxkxn feature descriptor matrix.
